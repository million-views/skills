# Reactive MD: Jobs To Be Done
> Recipe catalog organized by user intent

### 1. Create Product Specifications

**The Job**: Write PRDs with live, interactive examples that stakeholders can actually experience.
  > Define what to build and why it matters.

**Workflow**:
1. Browse `recipes/prd-templates/` or `recipes/case-studies/` for a starting point (or create a new markdown file)
2. Add interactive wireframes using Reactive MD
3. Include live component demos in your spec
4. Get stakeholder feedback without leaving your editor

*tags: prd, spec, feature, competitive, case study*

### 2. Design User Interfaces

**The Job**: Design interfaces with instant visual feedback, no build setup required.
  > Create visual concepts and page layouts.

**Workflow**:
1. Browse `recipes/design-systems/use-cases/` for layout patterns (landing pages, dashboards, settings) or `recipes/ui-catalog/` for components
2. Preview layouts instantly with `Cmd+K P`
3. Iterate on spacing, colors, and interactions
4. Share clickable prototypes with your team

*tags: landing, dashboard, settings, nav, table, modal, card, button, form*

### 3. Document User Journeys

**The Job**: Create interactive journey documentation that users can actually walk through.
  > Map out complete user experiences and flows.

**Workflow**:
1. Start with templates from `recipes/user-journeys/` (signup, checkout, search-to-purchase, support)
2. Add interactive steps with working components
3. Test the flow end-to-end in Reactive MD
4. Validate UX assumptions before development

*tags: signup, checkout, flow, journey, onboarding*

### 4. Prototype Features

**The Job**: Prototype features with real components, instant feedback, and no configuration overhead.
  > Validate ideas and explore possibilities quickly.

**Workflow**:
1. Pick a feature template from `recipes/feature-concepts/` (notifications, dark mode, infinite scroll, drag-and-drop, real-time)
2. Customize the interactive demo
3. Test user interactions and edge cases
4. Decide whether to build or iterate further

*tags: notification, dark, scroll, drag, realtime*

### 5. Build Design Systems

**The Job**: Develop components with immediate visual feedback, then document them with live examples.
  > Create and maintain reusable component libraries.

**Workflow**:
1. Read `recipes/design-systems/README.md` for architectural inspiration (token contracts, theming patterns)
2. Create your own design system with live token examples
3. Prove it out by implementing use-cases or porting examples from `recipes/design-systems/use-cases/`
4. Document your system with interactive component demos

*tags: component, library, design system, pattern*

### 6. Write Technical Documentation

**The Job**: Write docs with code examples that actually run and render.
  > Create documentation that developers can learn from and trust.

**Workflow**:
1. Browse recipes for documentation patterns (all categories include live examples)
2. Add `jsx live` code fences for interactive examples
3. Include working components that readers can modify
4. Keep examples current and testable

*tags: docs, documentation, tutorial, guide, example*
