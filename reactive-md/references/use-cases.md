# Reactive MD: IDE for Ideas

Executable specs in version control beat static docs + external tools. Live code + prose eliminates ambiguity. Stakeholders don't just imagine your idea, they experience it.

Use these workflows to understand where reactive-md excels.

### 1. Create Product Specifications

**The Job**: Write PRDs with live, interactive examples that stakeholders can actually experience.
  > Define what to build and why it matters.

**Workflow**:
1. Start with a template from [recipes/](./recipes/) (feature-spec, a-b-test-proposal, visual-essays) or create a new markdown file
2. Add interactive wireframes using Reactive MD
3. Include live component demos in your spec
4. Get stakeholder feedback without leaving your editor

*tags: prd, spec, feature, competitive*

### 2. Prototype Features

**The Job**: Build working prototypes with real components, instant feedback, and no setup overhead.
  > Validate ideas and explore edge cases quickly.

**Workflow**:
1. Browse [recipes/](./recipes/) for inspiration (dark-mode-toggle, notification-system, data-loading patterns)
2. Customize the interactive demo with your own requirements
3. Test user interactions and edge cases
4. Decide whether to build or iterate further

*tags: prototype, feature, interactive, demo*

### 3. Document Code Patterns

**The Job**: Create documentation with working code examples that developers can learn from.
  > Keep examples current and testable.

**Workflow**:
1. Write markdown prose explaining the pattern or problem
2. Add `jsx live` code fences for runnable examples
3. Include actual components and styles from your work
4. Link to related patterns and references

*tags: docs, documentation, patterns, examples*

### 4. Design Interfaces

**The Job**: Design and iterate on interfaces with instant visual feedback.
  > Create visual concepts before coding.

**Workflow**:
1. Create a markdown file with wireframe sketches or layout ideas
2. Embed interactive components that demonstrate the design
3. Iterate on spacing, colors, typography, and interactions
4. Share clickable prototypes with your team for feedback

*tags: design, layout, wireframe, interactive*

### 5. Build and Test Reusable Components

**The Job**: Develop components with immediate visual feedback, then document them.
  > Create and maintain component libraries.

**Workflow**:
1. Create a feature folder with README.md and component files
2. Use `jsx live` fences to demonstrate each component
3. Show variations, edge cases, and integration patterns
4. Document component props and usage patterns

*tags: components, library, patterns, design system*

### 6. Communicate Ideas Asynchronously

**The Job**: Share working prototypes with your team without meetings.
  > Iterate faster through version-controlled markdown.

**Workflow**:
1. Create a markdown file with your idea, mockups, and interactive demo
2. Commit to version control with clear commit messages
3. Share the file with your team for feedback
4. Iterate based on feedback without context-switching

*tags: communication, async, collaboration, prototyping*

### 7. Narrative & Data Storytelling

**The Job**: Create "Visual Essays" or "Data Journalism" pieces where the prose and visualizations are deeply integrated.
  > Turn static data into a narrative experience.

**Workflow**:
1. Gather datasets in `.json` or `.csv` sidecars
2. Write the narrative hub in `spec.md` using standard Markdown
3. Create custom SVG visualizations in sidecar `.jsx` files (Preview-safe with default props)
4. Embed interactive components that allow users to explore the data (filters, sliders, hovers)

*tags: journalism, data-viz, essay, narrative, storytelling*
