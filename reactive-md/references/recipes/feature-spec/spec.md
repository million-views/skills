# Unified Notification Center

## Problem Statement

Users miss important updates because we lack a unified notification system. Currently, critical alerts are buried in email, leading to delayed responses and frustrated customers. Product managers, engineers, and support staff need to see what's breaking—now—not dig through inbox noise.

## User Stories

**As a** product manager,
**I want** to see critical feature flags and deployment alerts in one place,
**so that** I can respond to production issues within minutes instead of hours.

**As an** engineer,
**I want** to archive notifications I've already acted on,
**so that** my notification center stays clean and only shows what needs attention.

**As a** customer success rep,
**I want** to see account-level alerts (failed payments, usage spikes),
**so that** I can proactively reach out before the customer even notices.

## Proposed Solution

Build a unified notification center that surfaces all critical alerts in one place with prioritization. Users see the most urgent notifications first, can quickly act on them, and archive resolved ones. Alerts no longer get lost in email—they're actionable and visible in the app.

### Component Variants

The notification center consists of these interactive states:

```jsx live
import FeatureSpecDemo from './proto-kit.jsx';

export default function Demo() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <FeatureSpecDemo
        title="Default State"
        buttonLabel="Enable"
      />

      <FeatureSpecDemo
        title="Pre-enabled Variant"
        buttonLabel="Disable"
        isActive={true}
      />

      <FeatureSpecDemo
        title="With Callback"
        buttonLabel="Toggle Feature"
        onStateChange={(state) => console.log('Feature is now:', state ? 'ON' : 'OFF')}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Default state**: Users see their notification list sorted by urgency (critical at top). They can scan and act quickly.

**Expanded notification**: Clicking a notification shows full context—what failed, suggested actions, and links to relevant docs or dashboards.

**Archive action**: Users can mark notifications as resolved, removing them from the active list but keeping audit history.

## Edge Cases

**Empty state**: A brand new user or someone whose alerts have all been archived. The notification center shouldn't feel broken—it should guide them. Expected: Friendly message explaining what notifications they'll see once alerts start firing, with a link to configure alert sources.

**Error state**: The notification service is temporarily down or a backend call fails. Users need to know something went wrong and what to do. Expected: Clear error message, retry button, and fallback to "Check notification settings" or "Refresh in a few moments."

**Loading state**: Notifications are being fetched. Expected: Skeleton placeholders that look like real notifications, maintaining layout so the UI doesn't jump around.

**Disabled state**: User doesn't have permission to view certain alerts (e.g., a customer can't see internal system alerts). Expected: Grayed out, non-clickable, with tooltip explaining why it's disabled.

### Empty State Example

```jsx live
export default function EmptyState() {
  return (
    <div className="@container text-center py-12 text-gray-500 bg-white rounded-xl">
      <div className="text-4xl mb-4">📭</div>
      <h3 className="font-medium mb-2">No items yet</h3>
      <p className="text-sm mb-6">When you have items, they'll show up here.</p>
      <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
        Create your first item
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Error State Example

```jsx live
export default function ErrorState() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-md mx-auto p-6 bg-red-50 rounded-lg border border-red-200">
      <div className="text-sm text-red-600 mb-4">⚠️ Error</div>
      <h3 className="font-bold text-red-800 mb-2">Something went wrong</h3>
      <p className="text-red-700 text-sm mb-6">
        We couldn't load your data. Please check your connection and try again.
      </p>
      <button className="w-full px-4 py-2 bg-red-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-red-700">
        Retry
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Loading State Example

```jsx live
export default function LoadingState() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded animate-pulse"></div>
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded animate-pulse w-5/6"></div>
      <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded animate-pulse w-4/6"></div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Disabled State Example

```jsx live
export default function DisabledState() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-md mx-auto p-6 bg-white rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
      <h3 className="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Feature Locked</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm mb-6">
        Upgrade your plan to unlock this feature.
      </p>
      <input
        type="text"
        disabled
        placeholder="This field is disabled"
        className="w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded bg-gray-100 text-gray-500 cursor-not-allowed mb-4"
      />
      <button
        disabled
        className="w-full px-4 py-2 bg-gray-300 text-gray-500 rounded cursor-not-allowed"
      >
        Action unavailable
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Technical Considerations

**Real-time updates**: How do we keep the notification list fresh without constant polling? Consider WebSocket connection or server-sent events (SSE) for live updates.

**Scalability**: Users with thousands of historical alerts shouldn't load all of them on first render. Pagination or infinite scroll is critical.

**Backwards compatibility**: The current email-based alert system stays unchanged. This feature adds a new channel, doesn't replace the old one yet.

## Open Questions

1. Should we support mobile push notifications in addition to in-app?
2. What's the retention policy—how long do we keep archived notifications?
3. Can users create custom notification filters (e.g., "only show critical + P0 bugs")?

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Users check the notification center at least 5x per day (adoption)
- [ ] Average time to acknowledge a critical alert drops from 30 min to 2 min
- [ ] Reduction in support tickets about missed alerts (20%+ decrease)
