# Test-pruning campaign

Campaign mode prunes one subsystem's whole test surface in one change set: a
single module, package, plugin, or feature area. The value bar, retention bar,
candidate evidence, and validation in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) apply to every
lane. This file adds the order of work and the lessons of a full campaign.
Each step ends on its completion criterion; do not start the next step early.

## 1. Baseline

Record the subsystem's test and test-support line counts and every test file's
pass/fail state at a pinned main-branch commit. Keep baseline failures in
their own list: they are frequently real product bugs, not stale tests.

Done when every in-scope test file has a recorded baseline result.

## 2. Lanes and inventory

Split the surface into **lanes** along production owner boundaries, not file
name prefixes. Typical lanes are things like configuration, commands, input
handling, output/delivery, persistence, transport, shared helpers, test
harness, and end-to-end or live scenarios. Include the subsystem's cases at
shared core boundaries and its QA or end-to-end harness tests.

Done when every test file and QA scenario the subsystem owns belongs to exactly
one lane.

## 3. Read-only ledger per lane

Give each lane to its own read-only reviewer (or agent, where available). The
reviewer reads every assigned test in full, including parameter tables. It also
reads the production owners and their entry points, callers, history, and CI
routing. Each test declaration goes into a written **ledger** with one mark. A
parameterized/table-driven test is one declaration unless its rows need
different marks; then mark each row.

- `R`: retain, naming the contract and the bug it catches; a retained test that
  only moves to a better-named file stays `R` with the move noted;
- `F`: retain the contract but repair the assertion, such as a vacuous negative
  that passes when only one of several items is missing;
- `C`: consolidate, naming the owner that absorbs the assertion first: a sibling
  table case, a stronger boundary suite, or the shared owner in another module;
- `D`: delete, naming the proof that remains, or why no contract exists.

Judge a test by its assertions, not its name. A test named for clearing some
state may in fact assert that the state was *not* cleared.

Done when every declaration in the lane has a mark and an evidence line.

## 4. Layer plan per lane

Treat the per-test ledger as input, not as the edit list. A second read-only
pass, starting from the ledger, looks for the redundant **layer**: for example,
several higher-level suites replaying the same shared component through one
mocked collaborator, surrounding stronger suites that already exercise the
real component. Name the **keeper** suite for each contract. Prefer the real
transport or I/O boundary with a fake external dependency over a mocked
internal collaborator. Correct any ledger errors this pass finds.

Done when each lane plan names its retired files, its keeper per contract, the
assertions to carry into keepers, and the test-only production seams unlocked.

## 5. Cutover

Edit lane by lane. Serialize changes to shared harnesses and support files
through one owner. With each lane, remove the test-only production seams it
unlocks: injection parameters, getters, reset exports, and indirection layers.
Register moved suites in CI routing and any test inventories. Update any
line-count or coverage baselines the project enforces. Record durable
test-ownership rules in the subsystem's contributor or agent guidance, drawn
from mistakes this campaign actually found.

Done when every lane plan is applied and each lane's keepers pass.

## 6. Preservation review

Before claiming completion, have independent reviewers compare deleted coverage
against the keepers, one reviewer per boundary group. They look for contracts
that lost their only proof. They also look for new assertions that cannot fail,
such as a rejection case the production code never reaches.

For each restored contract, make one deliberate **mutation** of the production
owner and confirm the keeper goes red. Then restore the source byte for byte.

Done when every reported gap is restored or rejected with source evidence, and
every restored contract has a caught mutation.

## 7. Product defects

A baseline failure that survives into a keeper is a bug report. Fix it at its
owner as a separate commit, and prove it through the real user flow, with a
**control** run that reverts the fix and shows the old behavior. Record
unrelated product discrepancies you find as follow-ups instead of fixing them
in the campaign.

Done when each repaired defect has a failing control and a passing candidate on
the same harness.

## 8. Reconcile and hand off

Campaigns outlive many main-branch commits. Merge main rather than rebasing a
long, many-commit campaign. When main modified a file the campaign deleted,
keep the deletion: port the new contract into the keeper instead, and confirm
every new regression main added still has a home. Rerun the whole subsystem
suite and repeat any end-to-end proof on the merged head.

Expect review tooling to show a truncated file list on a diff this large.
Record maintainer decisions about compatibility flags or gate exceptions in the
change description rather than editing the gates.

Hand off with the [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) report, plus:

- baseline and final test/support line counts, with production counted
  separately;
- lanes, retired layers, and keepers;
- preservation gaps found and their mutations;
- product defects with control and candidate proof.
